# Clima
### Which technologies did I use? ðŸ”§

* Xamarin Forms
* Plugin.LocalNotifications
* **[WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)**

## What is Clima?
Clima is an app that I made for myself, and while it functions as a weather app, it is primarily a weather reminder.

You can search for the city you want to know the current weather in (or the forecast for the next day). If you don't want to search, you can simply activate your location to view the local weather.

The app sends a notification at 10 PM (22:00 hrs) every day to remind you of the weather in a particular city. Initially, the app was designed for my personal use, and the default city is Caracas. However, it is not difficult to choose another city. If you want to set a different city, simply edit that variable in the 'ScheduleNotification' function.

## To use this code
To make the app work, you just need to register on [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/), obtain an API Key, and enter it in the 'GetWeather' function. Let's go through the steps:

+ 1: Register on [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/).
+ 2: Get your API Key.
+ 3: Go to *Clima -> ViewModel -> VMMainMenu*.
+ 4: Locate the 'GetWeather' function (line 175) and set your API Key in the apiKey variable.

Now, you can generate an APK or make other changes in the code.
